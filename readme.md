# Callback Hell
Its a situation where we call another function inside a function and then we call another fucnction inside that nested function.....


# In this Example
we create a function to get data from json file and we call that function again and again inside function .... the issue here is We have nested 3 callback functions within each other. This is called
callback hell. It is not very readable and it can get very messy very quickly. However it does work, it
gets the data in the correct order.
